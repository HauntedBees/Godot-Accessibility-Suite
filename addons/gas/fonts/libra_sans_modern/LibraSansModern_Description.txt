Libra Sans Modern is based on Libra Sans (https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/libra-sans) and contains two models of cyrillic glyph. The base range of the cyrillic glyphs (uni0410:uni044F) represents the modern Bulgarian letterform model. The traditional cyrillic letterform model is included as a local feature for Russian language. This is the main difference with Libra Sans where the traditional cyrillic letterform model is in the range uni0410:uni044F and the modern Bulgarian letterform model is included as local feature for Bulgarian language.
