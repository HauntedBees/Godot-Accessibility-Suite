# Godot Accessibility Suite
An attempt at making it as easy for you to follow as many of the guidelines from [gameaccessibilityguidelines.com](https://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/) as possible in your Godot 4.4+ games.

## Current Status
This was originally written for Godot 3.5, and while certain parts of it have been maintained over the past year as I've worked on my main Godot 4.x project, most of the rest of this suite has fallen behind. My hope is to have it in a presentable state by the end of November 2024.

## Contributing
If you would like to add to the project, by all means, go for it! All contributions must be made with a permissive open source license to ensure as many game developers as possible have access to this code.
