00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,657
One morning, when Gregor Samsa
woke from troubled dreams,

2
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:07,610
he found himself transformed in his
bed into a horrible vermin.

3
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:12,392
He lay on his armour-like back, and if he
lifted his head a little he could see 

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,942
his brown belly, slightly domed and
divided by arches into stiff sections.

5
00:00:17,202 --> 00:00:21,785
The bedding was hardly able to cover it and
seemed ready to slide off any moment.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,262
His many legs, pitifully thin compared
with the size of the rest of him,

7
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:28,505
waved about helplessly as he looked.
